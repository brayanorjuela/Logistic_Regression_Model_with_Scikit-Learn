# Logistic Regression Model with Scikit-Learn

Project from DataCamp in which the skills needed to create a logistic regression model to predict a variable of interest are put to the test.

The main goal of this project is to ensure the ability to develop a logistic regression model in order to predict if a bank customer should be given a credit card based on multiple information about the client such as income, debt, credit score, among others. This is done initially through the preprocessing of the data used for this model. This consists of removing irrelevant information, changing some of the variable data types, finding and imputing missing values, encoding categorical variables numerically and scaling the variables. After this, the model was created using scikit-learn and the best hyperparameters for this model were determined through a grid search cross validation. The evaluation regarding the ability to develop such model takes place through the completion of a series of tasks presented in the jupyter notebook in this repository.

**The project tasks were developed by the platform DataCamp and they were completed by Brayan Orjuela**
